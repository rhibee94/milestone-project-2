## Cats and Dogs, Memory and Merge
### memory game 
this is a memory game that turns into a merge game.
you start off by pairing up the cats and dogs on level one then on level 2 you are merging together the same animals you paired up 
in the first level.
# level 1
## paring the cats and dogs
this is a memory challenge that puts your mind to the test, you have to remmember where the matching animal is so it is simular 
to majong in that sense, there will be 10 different cats and 10 different dogs. so 20 of each in total.
- 20 cats
- 20 dogs 
# level 2
## merging the cats and dogs
the animals that you have paired together you are now merging so that for example - 
- a ginger cat becomes a tabby cat
- a tabby cat becomes a ragdoll cat
- a ragdoll cat becomes a Siamese cat
- and so on until the cats become dogs and you carry on untill all 20 have been merged.
